            <h2>Background Story</h2>
            <p2>Bulgogi (pronounced bool-goh-gee with a hard g) is a Korean beef dish that literally translates to "fire meat". It is a Korean dish
                that is made from thinly marinated slices of beef, sometimes pork, that is cooked over a grill or a stove-top griddle. However,
                in home cooking, frying in a pan is the best route to take. It is one of the most popular and well-known Korean traditional dishes. 
                While throughout times, and depending on various regions, bulgogi can be prepared in various ways. This recipe will focus on creating an 
                authentic and most common way of creating one of Korea's national dishes. This recipe serves 4-6 peoples!
            </p2>

            <h2>Korean Substitutes</h2>
            <p2>Korean supermarkets will sell thinly sliced pre-cut beef specifically for bulgogi, and other dishes alike. However, most 
                grocery stores do not have this option, or have a butcher on-site. This is an easy fix! All you will need is a cut of tender beef. 
                Sirloin, beef tenderloin, or rib-eye is preferred. You will want to sharpen that knife for this part. Take your beef, wrap it in 
                plastic wrap, and freeze for about 2-3 hours. Freezing is important since we will be wanting to cut the items very thin. Remove the 
                meat from the freezer and begin slicing against the grain. 2-3mm or 1/8 of an inch is the desired thickness.

                The ingredient list also called for a Korean or asian pear. If this is unavailable, use a regular pear or an apple! While the fruit
                does add some sweetness to the dish, we are looking for the acidity of the fruit. The main purpose for this ingredient is to tenderize
                the meat while it is marinating.

            <h2>How to prepare and eat!</h2>

            <p2>
                Bulgogi, as it's name, is typically cooked with fire. So a traditional barbecue is ideal to get some great char and get some smokey
                flavour. However, depending on location, barbecues are not great for every season. And once you try this recipe, this will be a year
                round dish. Cooking on a pan does have it's bonuses. Pan cooking allows for juices to be released and kept throughout the entire cooking
                process. Something that lacks of the fire grilled barbecue. If you want a great combination of both the smoky flavour, and extremely juicy
                beef. Try opting for a well-seasoned skillet. Keep the portion of meat you are cooking to a minimum as too much meat equates to too much
                juice. That will take away the ability of creating a smokey flavour. The key is to have that skillet on high heat before adding the meat.
                This will create a carmelization of the marinade, and providing that smokey char.

                The best part. How to eat. The traditional way of eating bulgogi, is pairing the dish with a bowl of rice, an ample amount of  banchan (side
                dishes), leaf lettuce, perilla leaves, and ssam-jang (korean dipping sauce). Koreans will typically make a ssam (wrap) with the bulgogi.
                It's easy! Just grab yourself a leaf lettuce, lay a perilla leaf on top, add some rice and whatever banchan your heart desires, some 
                ssam-jang, and a serving of that delicious bulgogi. Wrap it all up and dig in! While this is a great way, and the best way in my opinion.
                Bulgogi can be used in many different ways. Think outside of the box! Tacos, sandwiches, salads, you name it!

                <h2>LET'S COOK</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. In a food processor or blender, take all the ingredients for your marinade and blend it all up! We are looking for
                        a very smooth consistency. Make sure the marinade is not chunky!</li>
                    <li>2. Place your meat in a bowl and add pour you marinade over. Mix together well. Pro tip: be sure to wear gloves when doing
                        this. The marinade smell is very strong and will stay with you if you don't.
                    </li>
                    <li>3. Add the rest of your ingredients to your bowl and begin mixing again. You will want to put the mix in a container or cover
                        the bowl in cling wrap. Let it marinade in the fridge for at least 4 hours. Overnight marinade is better though.
                    </li>
                    <li>4. Preheat your pan/skillet/grill. Add your cooking oil and coat well. Add the meat to your cooking device and cook for 3-5
                        minutes. Be sure to toss semi frequently while cooking.
                    </li>
                    <li>5. After cooking, plate your dish and garnish with some sesame seeds.</li>
                    <li>6. ENJOY!</li>
